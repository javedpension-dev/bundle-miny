# What is this?
This is a mini project of mine to make a more usable bundle. It does not have all the fancy things, but comes equiped with the essentials.

# Features
- Automatic chat delaying. Will delay any messages sent during the cooldown period, so your messages don't get lost!

# Build

To build, simply run
```bash
npm run build
```

This will make a directory `dist` with a bundle.js file.


# TO DO
- Support region selector with discord authentication system (fixed, used localstorage system to store account details because thats all that we care about for now.)
- Fix Canvas2D render. I have no clue what's wrong with it.
